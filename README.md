# gossips.cafe ☕️

Gossips is a cafe on the internet.

## Hours
8am to 7pm daily.

## Cafe tunes
A selection of tunes posted by people that hang out in the cafe.

## Coffee break
Interesting links for downtime.

## Clock in
Feel free to clock in throughout the day. Remember when Twitter was just people talking about what they were doing? The cafe should feel a bit like that.

## Archive
There is no archive. Cafe posts are given a [TTL](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/expire-data/) (time to live) so that they expire 8 hours after their creation. Feel free to archive the site by saving it locally.

## Philosophy
- The cafe will never be secure.
- No logins. Total trust.
- No notifications ever! Check it when you feel like it.
- The cafe should feel more like a document than an app.
- The cafe should have a good vibe. Some venting is okay.
- For every change to the cafe ask, "What would a real cafe do?"

## Community
The hope is to keep the cafe small and off the radar but feel free to invite people to the cafe that you trust and or link to it from your personal website/blog.

## Todo/Ideas

- Add Mark's firefly css animation when the cafe is closed.
- A place for cafe artwork/shows (suggested by Laurel)
- @callil suggested that the cafe tunes should have a play button like mac.are.na.
- Should the cafe hold more than 40 people? Maybe we close if there's a spike in traffic?

## Manager
The cafe is currently run by Elliott (elliott@phantomwifi.com)
